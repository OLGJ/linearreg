# This is a vignette for the linreg package. 

The linreg package contains a ReferenceClass which provides some basic statistical
methods. The code for how these statistics are calculated and implemented in the 
package can be found in `R/linreg.R`.


## An example to start working with the package:
```{r setup}
library(linearreg)

# linear regression will be calculated on the iris dataset.
a <- linreg(formula = Petal.Length~Species, data = iris)

# To see an overview:
a$print()

# Or check out the built in .self$ variables
a$residuals

# It's possible to press tab after a$ to get an overview.

# To access the methods of the package you proceed in a similar fashion.
# Accessing the methods can be done via:
a$summary()

```

### Enjoy!
